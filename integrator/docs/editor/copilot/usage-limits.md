# Usage Limits

When you sign in to WSO2 Integrator Copilot with your WSO2 Cloud account, your usage is subject to a limit. Copilot shows how much you have used, lets you know when you reach the limit, and gives you a way to ask for more.

If you signed in with your own AI provider credentials, Copilot shows your provider instead of a usage figure, for example **Anthropic (own key)**. Your provider account handles usage and billing, so this page does not apply to you.

## Check your usage

The Copilot panel header shows **Usage** with how much of your limit you have used so far. Point at it to see when your usage resets.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The usage indicator in the Copilot panel header."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/usage-badge.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/usage-badge.png'),
    }}
/>

Copilot updates this each time you open the panel and after every response, so the figure is always current.

## When you reach the limit

When you reach your limit, Copilot pauses and displays a message above the chat box with the date and time your usage resets.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The usage limit message above the Copilot chat box."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/usage-limit-notice.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/usage-limit-notice.png'),
    }}
/>

Until your usage resets, Copilot's AI services are unavailable and you cannot send new messages.

A refresh button appears beside **Usage**. Select it to check your usage again, for example after your usage resets or after the team grants you more.

Your project is unaffected. Reaching the limit only pauses new messages, and everything Copilot has already built remains in place.

## Ask for more usage

If you need to continue before your usage resets, select **Request additional quota** in the message.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The Request additional quota form."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/quota-request-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/quota-request-form.png'),
    }}
/>

You are welcome to add a short note about what you are working on, then select **Submit**. Your account email is included with the request so that the team can get back to you.

The team reviews each request and decides how much to grant, so requests are not approved automatically. Once you have submitted a request, the message confirms it and you do not need to ask again.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The message confirming that a request has been submitted."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/quota-request-submitted.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/quota-request-submitted.png'),
    }}
/>

When the team grants more usage, select the refresh button beside **Usage** to pick it up.
