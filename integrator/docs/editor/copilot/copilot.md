# WSO2 Integrator Copilot

If you have already [signed up for WSO2 Cloud](../../get-started/setup/setup.md) and are working in the cloud editor, WSO2 Integrator Copilot uses the same authentication and is ready to use. Otherwise, sign in from the Copilot welcome screen.

## Sign in from the Copilot welcome screen

1. Open your integration's overview to start working with Copilot.

   - **New integration**: The overview shows the Copilot composer. Describe what you want to build and send it, or pick one of the examples under **Try one of these**. To open the Copilot panel without a prompt, select the Copilot orb above the composer.

     <ThemedImage

         sources={{
             light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/copilot-composer.png'),
             dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/copilot-composer.png'),
         }}
     />

   - **Integration with artifacts**: Select the Copilot orb in the bottom-right corner. Select it once for a quick chat, or double-click it to open the full Copilot panel.

         sources={{

             dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/copilot-orb.png'),
         }}
     />

   When a Ballerina file or diagram is open, you can also select the **Open WSO2 Integrator Copilot** icon in the editor toolbar.

2. The Copilot panel opens on the welcome screen with the available sign-in options.

           dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/copilot-sign-in.png'),
       }}
   />
