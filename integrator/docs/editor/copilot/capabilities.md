# Copilot Built-in Capabilities

WSO2 Integrator Copilot builds integrations from natural language prompts. It produces ready-to-use artifacts in your project. Iterate through follow-up prompts to refine logic, add features, or modify behavior.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/copilot-overview.png'),
    }}
/>

## Clarifying requirements

During the planning or generation phase, Copilot may identify missing information that is critical to the integration. If a requirement is ambiguous, it pauses and presents a list of suggested options. Select one, or select **Other** to type your own answer.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Clarifying requirements prompt showing selection options."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/clarifying-requirements.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/clarifying-requirements.png'),
    }}
/>

## Using web tools

Copilot can search the internet for external context or up-to-date documentation. It asks for permission before each search unless you enable the web tools toggle in the input bar.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Web tools permission prompt in the Copilot input bar."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/web-tool.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/web-tool.png'),
    }}
/>

## Generating connectors

Copilot can generate a custom connector when a pre-built one is not available. During integration generation, if no pre-built connector exists, Copilot prompts the user for an OpenAPI specification. The user can also directly request to generate a custom connector. Once generated, the connector is available for Copilot to use in the flow.

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/connector-generator.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/connector-generator.png'),
    }}
/>

## Review generated artifacts

After generation completes, you can inspect exactly what was built or changed before finalizing the changes. Review the generated artifacts as the flow diagram or as source code with a diff view.

<ThemedImage

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/review-mode.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/review-mode.png'),
    }}
/>

## Configure to Run/Test

When you run or test the integration, Copilot identifies the required configurables and prompts you to enter them.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Configuration collection prompt showing required fields for the integration."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/config-collection.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/config-collection.png'),
    }}
/>

## Generate Integration Tests

Copilot generates tests for your integration and runs them with the built-in test runner, allowing you to verify the generated artifacts immediately.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Test runner showing generated tests and results."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/running-tests.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/running-tests.png'),
    }}
/>

## TryOut your services

Once your integration is running, you can send test requests to your services from Copilot. Describe what you want to test in plain language, and Copilot calls your service and returns the response.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Copilot calling a running service and showing the response."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/try-it.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/try-it.png'),
    }}
/>

## Debug Runtime Issues

Copilot can run your integrations and read the runtime logs to debug issues as they occur.

<ThemedImage

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/debugging-using-service-logs.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/debugging-using-service-logs.png'),
    }}
/>

## Follow-up suggestions

When Copilot finishes a response, it offers a few follow-up suggestions as chips below the message. Each chip is a short label for a sensible next step, such as adding a test, handling an error case, or running the service.

Select a chip to place its full prompt in the input bar. Copilot doesn't send it, so you can reword the prompt or add detail first.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Follow-up suggestion chips below a Copilot response."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/followup-suggestions.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/followup-suggestions.png'),
    }}
/>

Suggestions appear under the most recent response only, and they clear when you send your next message.

To turn suggestions off, set `ballerina.copilot.followupSuggestions` to `false` in your editor settings.

## Chat sessions

Each conversation with Copilot is a session. Copilot saves every session for the project, so your work stays available after you reload or restart the editor. Sessions are tied to the project's location on disk, so they no longer appear if you move or rename the project, or open it from a different path.

Select **Chats** in the panel header to list the project's sessions, grouped by when you last used them. Each row shows the session name, the number of prompts it holds, and when it was last updated. Select a row to switch to that session.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The Chats list showing the saved sessions for a project."
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/chat-sessions.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/copilot/chat-sessions.png'),
    }}
/>

From this list you can:

- **Start a session**: Select **New Chat**. Your existing sessions are kept.
- **Find a session**: Type in **Search sessions** to filter the list by name.
- **Rename a session**: Select the edit icon on the row. Copilot names a session after its first prompt, so renaming helps when several sessions begin alike. If you clear the name, Copilot restores the original.
- **Delete a session**: Select the delete icon, then confirm.

You can't switch sessions while Copilot is generating a response. Finish or stop the response first.

To undo what Copilot changed, select **Restore Checkpoint**. It rolls your integration back to a saved checkpoint and removes the prompts that came after it.
