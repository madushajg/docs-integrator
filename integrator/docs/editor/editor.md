# Understand the Editor

The **WSO2 Integrator editor** brings together everything you need to develop, build, test, debug and deploy your integrations in one place. This tour works outward from the window you see when you open it, to the surfaces you build on, to the tools available throughout. The map below gives you the shape of it before you go deeper into any one piece.
