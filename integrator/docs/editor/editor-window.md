# Editor Window

Every view you open in WSO2 Integrator ([Project view](views/project-view.md), [Integration view](views/integration-view.md), [Library view](views/library-view.md), and so on) renders inside the same window with a top menu bar, an activity bar on the far-left edge, an editor tab area with editor toolbar, and the side panels for the project explorer and deployment options. This page describes the parts of that window that stay the same across views, so the view-specific pages do not need to repeat them.

## Top menu bar

The top menu bar runs across the top edge of the application window and groups the standard application menus.

        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/top-menu-bar.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/top-menu-bar.png'),
    }}
/>

| Menu | Description |
|---|---|
| **WSO2 Integrator** | Application-level actions such as About, Preferences, and Quit. |
| **File** | Open, save, and close projects, files, and windows. |
| **Edit** | Standard editing actions such as undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, and find. |
| **Selection** | Selection and multi-cursor actions for the source editor. |
| **View** | Toggle the activity bar, side bar, panel, terminal, and other layout elements. |
| **Go** | Navigation actions such as Go to File, Go to Definition, and Go to Symbol. |
| **Run** | Run and debug actions for the active integration. |
| **Terminal** | Open and manage integrated terminals. |
| **Window** | Manage open windows. |
| **Help** | Documentation, release notes, and support links. |

The top menu bar covers general application actions. Integrator-specific actions live in the [activity bar](#activity-bar) and the [editor toolbar](#editor-toolbar).

## Activity bar

The activity bar is the narrow vertical strip on the far-left edge of the IDE. Each icon opens a different panel or tool, and the active icon is highlighted.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Activity bar"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/activity-bar.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/activity-bar.png'),
    }}
/>

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| **Explorer** | Opens the file explorer to browse the raw project files on disk, such as `.bal` source files and `.toml` configuration files. |
| **WSO2 Integrator** | Opens the project explorer for the current view. This is the main entry point back to your project. |
| **Source Control** | Opens the Git source control panel for staging, committing, and reviewing changes. |
| **Run and Debug** | Opens the debug panel for setting breakpoints, launching the integration with the debugger, and inspecting variables. |
| **Test Explorer** | Opens the test explorer to view, run, and debug the test cases defined for your integration. |
| **Accounts** | Shows the signed-in WSO2 Integrator account and provides actions to manage extension account preferences and language model access. |
| **Manage** | Opens the IDE management menu with access to the Command Palette, Profiles, Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, Snippets, Tasks, and Themes. |

Select the **WSO2 Integrator** icon at any time to return to the project explorer and the current view.

## Project explorer

The project explorer is the left sidebar that organizes the contents of your project into a structured tree.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Project explorer"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/project-explorer.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/project-explorer.png'),
    }}
/>

- At the **project level**, the project explorer lists all integrations and libraries in the project, grouped by name. Each entry is expandable to reveal its own artifact tree.
- Inside an **integration or library**, the project explorer organizes its components into sections by artifact type, making it easy to locate and manage the building blocks of your integration.

When an integration or library is open, the project explorer groups its artifacts into the following sections. Select an artifact name to open it in its dedicated view, or select the **+** icon next to a section to add a new one.

| Section | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Entry Points** | HTTP services, GraphQL services, automations, and event listeners that trigger your integration. |
| **Listeners** | Protocol-specific configurations (host, port) that entry points bind to. |
| **Connections** | Configured links to external systems such as databases, HTTP APIs, and message brokers. |
| **Types** | Custom records, enums, arrays, service classes, and unions used in your integration. |
| **Functions** | Reusable logic blocks callable from entry points or other functions. |
| **Data Mappers** | Visual transformations between source and target types. |
| **Configurations** | Variables sourced from `Config.toml` at runtime. |

For details on each artifact type, see [Integration artifacts](../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/integration-artifacts.md).

## Editor tab area

The editor tab area sits above the canvas and shows one tab per open editor. The active tab is highlighted, and you can close a tab with the **×** action on it.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Editor tab area"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/editor-tab-bar.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/editor-tab-bar.png'),
    }}
/>

The **WSO2 Integrator** tab represents the visual designer for the current view. Other tabs, such as a Ballerina source file opened from the explorer, appear alongside it.

### Editor toolbar

The editor toolbar appears on the right side of the editor tab bar and provides quick actions for the active integration.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Editor toolbar with Run, Debug, Show Source, Split editor, and More actions highlighted"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/editor-toolbar.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/editor-toolbar.png'),
    }}
/>

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **WSO2 Integrator Copilot** | Opens the [WSO2 Integrator Copilot](copilot/capabilities.md) chat panel for AI-powered assistance with building and troubleshooting your integration. |
| **Run** | Builds and runs the integration locally, starting all services and streaming output to the terminal. |
| **Debug** | Launches the integration with the debugger attached so you can set breakpoints and inspect variables. |
| **Show Source** | Switches the editor from the visual designer to the Ballerina source for the current artifact. |
| **Split editor** | Opens the active editor in a second column so you can view two surfaces side by side. |
| **More** (**⋯**) | Reveals additional editor actions, such as reopening recently closed editors and pinning the tab. |

The toolbar is the same across the [Project view](views/project-view.md), [Integration view](views/integration-view.md), and [Library view](views/library-view.md), so the view-specific pages refer back to this section instead of repeating it.

## Status bar

The status bar runs across the bottom edge of the IDE and shows the current state of your project, runtime, and tooling at a glance. Select an item to open the related panel or action.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Status bar"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/status-bar.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/editor-window/status-bar.png'),
    }}
/>

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| **Branch indicator** (for example, `main*`) | Shows the active Git branch for the project. An asterisk indicates uncommitted changes. Select it to switch or manage branches. |
| **Problems** (error and warning counts) | Shows the number of errors and warnings detected in the current project. Select it to open the Problems panel. |
| **Ballerina version** | Shows the Ballerina distribution version that the IDE is using to build and run your integration (for example, `Ballerina 2201.13.4 (Swan Lake Update 13)`). |
| **ICP** | Shows the status of the [Integration Control Plane](../icp/index.md) connection (for example, `ICP: Stopped`). Select it to start, stop, or configure ICP for the project. |
| **Notifications** | Opens the notifications panel for messages from the IDE and its extensions. |
