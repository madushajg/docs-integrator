# Deploy to WSO2 Cloud from the Editor

You can deploy your integrations to WSO2 Cloud directly from the WSO2 Integrator editor. You can deploy the entire project at once or deploy a single integration individually.

:::info Prerequisites
- An integration or project with integration(s) created in the WSO2 Integrator editor.

## Deploy the whole project

1. In the WSO2 Integrator editor, open the project overview canvas.

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Project Overview"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/img/deploy/cloud/deploy-from-editor/project-overview.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/img/deploy/cloud/deploy-from-editor/project-overview.png'),
        }}
    />

2. Under **Deployment Options** in the right column, locate the **Deploy to WSO2 Cloud** box and click **Deploy**.
3. If you are not already signed in to WSO2 Cloud, the editor prompts you to sign in. Click **Sign In** and complete the authentication in the browser, then return to the editor.
4. When prompted, select the organization on WSO2 Cloud. You can select an existing project or click **Create New** to create one.

   A new tab opens showing your project's integrations. By default, all integrations are selected for deployment.

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Deploying Integrations to WSO2 Cloud - Set up a Repository"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/img/deploy/cloud/deploy-from-editor/deploy-tab.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/img/deploy/cloud/deploy-from-editor/deploy-tab.png'),
        }}
    />

5. If your project is not yet connected to a remote repository, you will see a warning as shown below. You will need to set one up before continuing. If it is already connected, skip to step 6.

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Deploying Integrations to WSO2 Cloud"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/img/deploy/cloud/deploy-from-editor/deploy-tab-setup-repository.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/img/deploy/cloud/deploy-from-editor/deploy-tab-setup-repository.png'),
        }}
    />

    a. In the WSO2 Integrator editor, click **Source Control** in the left sidebar.

    b. Click **Initialize Repository**. This creates a local Git repository inside your project folder.

    c. In the **Source Control** sidebar, type a commit message and click **Commit**. When prompted, click **Yes** to stage and commit all files.

    d. Click **Publish**. If you are not signed in to GitHub, the editor prompts you to authorize access. Complete the sign-in in the browser and return to the editor.

    e. When prompted, select a repository name and visibility (**Public** or **Private**). The editor creates the repository on GitHub and pushes your code to it.

6. If WSO2 Cloud does not have access to your remote repository, a warning appears. Click the link to grant access on GitHub, complete the authorization, then return to the editor and click **Refresh** to validate access.
7. Click **Deploy All**.

   WSO2 Cloud creates the integrations. Once the deployment is complete, click **View in Console**.

A browser opens showing your project on WSO2 Cloud.

<ThemedImage
    alt="WSO2 Cloud Project Home"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/deploy/cloud/deploy-from-editor/project-page-wso2-cloud.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/deploy/cloud/deploy-from-editor/project-page-wso2-cloud.png'),
    }}
/>

## Deploy a single integration

1. In the WSO2 Integrator editor, open the integration overview canvas for the integration you want to deploy.
2. Under **Deployment Options** in the right column, locate the **Deploy to WSO2 Cloud** box and click **Deploy**.
3. Follow the same steps as the whole-project flow, and click **Deploy**.

   Once the deployment is complete, click **View in Console**.

A browser opens showing the deployed integration directly on WSO2 Cloud.

## Other ways to deploy

- **[Import a project](import-project.md)** — Import a whole WSO2 Integrator project and configure all its integrations at once.
- **[Import an integration](import-integration.md)** — Import a single integration from an existing repository.
- **[Deploy from the cloud editor](deploy-from-cloud-editor.md)** — Build and deploy directly in the browser-based cloud editor, without installing anything locally.

Importing a project or integration connects it to a Git repository. From then on, every commit to the configured branch builds and deploys automatically. GitHub connects with one click; for Bitbucket, GitLab, or Azure DevOps, see [Connect a Git provider](connect-git-provider.md) first.
