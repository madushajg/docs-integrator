title: Management API

# Management API

Every integration with durable workflows can expose a **Management API**: a REST surface, served by the integration runtime itself, over the runs that integration owns. Enable it to build custom portals, automations, or operational tooling.

This is not the Integration Control Plane server's own API. ICP serves the console over GraphQL and spans every registered integration, while the API on this page is integration-local and reaches only one runtime. See [Integration Control Plane](../../../../icp/index.md) for that side.

## Enable the API

The REST surface lives in its own module, `ballerina/workflow.management.rest`. Bring it into the integration from the designer or by hand. Either way, nothing else about how the workflows run changes.

### From the designer

1. Open the integration overview.
2. In the right panel, below **Integration Control Plane**, find the **Workflow** section.
3. Select **Enable Workflow Management REST API**.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The integration overview with the Workflow section highlighted in the right panel, showing the Enable Workflow Management REST API checkbox below Integration Control Plane"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/management-api/enable-management-api.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/management-api/enable-management-api.png'),
    }}
/>

Selecting it adds the `ballerina/workflow.management.rest` import to `main.bal`.

### By hand

Import the module in the integration:

```ballerina
import ballerina/workflow.management.rest as _;
```

### Switch it on

Importing the module alone opens no port. The API starts only when `enableManagementApi` is `true`. Set it, along with the port, TLS, and CORS settings, from the configuration editor, or directly in `Config.toml` under the module's own table:

```toml
[ballerina.workflow.management.rest]
enableManagementApi = true
port = 8234                 # default
```

Base URL: `http://<host>:8234/workflow`

:::info Two modules, two tables
`ballerina/workflow.management` holds the programmatic operations and opens no port on its own. `ballerina/workflow.management.rest` is the HTTP adapter over them, and it is the one this page configures. The engine settings that decide where runs are recorded are separate again, under `[ballerina.workflow]`. See [Deployment modes](deployment-modes.md).

## Authentication

Authentication is configured under the same table. **Basic authentication is on by default**, so enabling the API without choosing a scheme fails at startup rather than quietly publishing an open endpoint.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enableBasicAuth` | `true` | HTTP basic authentication against Ballerina's file user store, with credentials from `[[ballerina.auth.users]]`. |
| `enableJwtAuth` | `false` | JWT bearer tokens validated against a JWKS endpoint. Requires `jwtIssuer`, `jwtAudience`, and `jwksUrl`. |
| `enableOAuth` | `false` | OAuth2 bearer tokens validated by introspection. Requires `oauth2IntrospectionUrl`. |
| `enableApiKey` | `false` | A shared key in a request header. Requires `apiKeyValue`. The header name is `apiKeyHeader`, `x-api-key` by default. |

More than one scheme can be enabled at once, and a request passes if it satisfies any one of them. Turning a scheme on without its required settings panics at startup with a message naming what is missing, rather than failing later at runtime.

Enabling TLS and restricting CORS use the same table:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enableTls` | `false` | Serves over HTTPS. Requires `certFile` and `keyFile`, both PEM. |
| `enableCors` | `true` | Sends CORS headers. Set it to `false` when a gateway handles CORS. |
| `corsAllowOrigins` | `["*"]` | Restrict this in production, for example to `["https://portal.example.com"]`. |
| `corsAllowHeaders` | `Content-Type`, `x-user-id`, `x-user-roles`, `Authorization`, `x-api-key` | If you change `apiKeyHeader`, add the new name to this list. |

An externally exposed deployment. Basic auth credentials are not settings of this module: they come from Ballerina's own file user store table.

```toml
[ballerina.workflow.management.rest]
enableManagementApi = true
enableTls           = true
certFile            = "/etc/certs/tls.crt"
keyFile             = "/etc/certs/tls.key"

[[ballerina.auth.users]]
username = "ops"
password = "s3cret!"
```

A cluster-internal deployment behind a service mesh that already handles identity:

```toml
[ballerina.workflow.management.rest]
enableManagementApi = true
enableBasicAuth     = false
```

:::warning An unauthenticated API is open to the port
Setting `enableBasicAuth = false` with no other scheme enabled leaves the API open to anyone who can reach the port. The startup log says which schemes are in force, and reports `none` when there are none, so check it after a configuration change. Only do this where something in front of the port, such as a service mesh, establishes identity.

## Caller identity

Operations record who acted, and filter tasks and reviews by the caller's roles. Where that identity comes from depends on the scheme in force.

| Scheme | Where identity comes from |
|---|---|
| Basic auth or API key | The `x-user-id` and `x-user-roles` request headers, read as identity forwarded by a trusted gateway. Basic auth additionally defaults the user ID to the authenticated username. |
| JWT or OAuth2 | The token's claims, which replace any forwarded headers so a client cannot assert another identity alongside a valid token. |

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `x-user-id` | Recorded in audit fields such as `completedBy` and `decidedBy`. |
| `x-user-roles` | Comma-separated role names. Tasks and reviews are filtered and authorized against them. |

In token mode, `userIdClaim` (default `sub`) and `rolesClaim` (default `roles`) name the claims to read, and both accept dotted paths for nested claims, such as `realm_access.roles`. Set `trustForwardedIdentity = true` to give the headers precedence again, for a topology where a trusted gateway terminates OAuth and forwards identity itself.

:::warning Identity headers are asserted, not verified
Under basic auth or API key, the runtime reads `x-user-id` and `x-user-roles` as sent and does not verify them, so a caller that reaches the port directly can name any user and any role. Do not expose the port to untrusted callers. Terminate authentication in front of it, at a gateway or reverse proxy that strips both headers from the incoming request and sets them from the identity it verified. Under JWT or OAuth2 the token's claims win, so this does not apply unless you set `trustForwardedIdentity = true`.

### Scopes

With `enforceScopes = true`, token-based callers must also carry an OAuth scope for the class of operation they are invoking. Scopes are read from the `scope` claim, space-delimited, or the `scp` claim. Scope enforcement requires JWT or OAuth2 to be enabled, and panics at startup otherwise.

| Scope | Default value | Permits |
|---|---|---|
| `scopeWorkflowView` | `workflow:view` | Reading workflows: list, get, history, graphs. |
| `scopeWorkflowManage` | `workflow:manage` | Mutating workflows: start, suspend, resume, terminate, cancel. Implies the view scope on workflow routes. |
| `scopeHumanTaskView` | `humantask:view` | Reading human tasks. |
| `scopeHumanTaskManage` | `humantask:manage` | Mutating human tasks: complete, fail. Implies the view scope on human-task routes. |

Scopes are separate from roles. A scope authorizes a class of operation, while whether a particular task is yours to decide is still the task's own audience: its roles or user ID, minus its exclusions.

## Runtime and definitions

| Method and path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /runtime` | This worker's runtime state. Returns `{"taskQueue": "..."}`. |
| `GET /definitions` | The workflow types this integration registers, for launcher UIs. |

## Workflow instances

| Method and path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /workflows` | List instances. Filters: `status`, `workflowType`, `workflowId`, `startedBy`, `taskQueue`, the four time bounds `startTimeFrom`, `startTimeTo`, `closeTimeFrom`, `closeTimeTo`, and pagination with `limit` (default `20`) and `pageToken`. |
| `POST /workflows` | Start a workflow: `{"workflowType": "...", "input": {…}}`, optionally with `workflowId` and `timeoutSeconds`. |
| `GET /workflows/{workflowId}` | Instance detail: type, status, result, and activity invocations. |
| `GET /workflows/{workflowId}/history` | Full recorded event history. |
| `GET /workflows/{workflowId}/activity-tree` | The execution as a tree of typed nodes with inputs, outputs, and attempts. |
| `GET /workflows/{workflowId}/execution-graph` | Nodes and edges of the execution so far. |
| `POST /workflows/{workflowId}/suspend` | Pause the instance. |
| `POST /workflows/{workflowId}/resume` | Resume a suspended instance. |
| `POST /workflows/{workflowId}/wake` | Wake the instance. |
| `POST /workflows/{workflowId}/cancel` | Request graceful cancellation. |
| `POST /workflows/{workflowId}/terminate` | Stop immediately, with no cleanup. Optional body `{"reason": "..."}`. |
| `POST /workflows/{workflowId}/data/{dataName}` | Deliver a named data event. The body is the payload, verbatim, so a workflow awaiting `dataEvents.approval` receives exactly what is posted. |
| `GET /workflows/{workflowId}/reset-points` | The points this run can be reset to. |
| `POST /workflows/{workflowId}/reset` | Replay the run from a chosen point. See [Reset a run](#reset-a-run). |

Execution-graph and activity-tree nodes are typed `ACTIVITY`, `TIMER`, `DATA`, `CHILD_WORKFLOW`, `HUMAN_TASK`, or `REVIEW_ACTIVITY`, and carry a status of `RUNNING`, `WAITING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `TIMED_OUT`, or `CANCELED`. A `DATA` node with status `WAITING` marks a data event the workflow is currently blocked on.

### Run-pinned variants

The routes above target the latest, or currently active, run of an instance. Insert `/{runId}` after the workflow ID to pin a request to one exact run:

```
GET  /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}
GET  /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}/history
GET  /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}/activity-tree
GET  /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}/execution-graph
GET  /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}/reset-points
POST /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}/suspend
POST /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}/resume
POST /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}/cancel
POST /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}/terminate
POST /workflows/{workflowId}/{runId}/reset
```

`wake` and the data-event route have no run-pinned form. A data event always reaches the instance's running run.

### Example: find where an instance is halted

```bash
WORKFLOW_ID="019ffed4-c12e-7e24-a438-8bdaae2b5a29"
curl -s "http://localhost:8234/workflow/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/execution-graph" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -H 'x-user-roles: manager' | jq '.nodes[] | select(.status=="WAITING" or .status=="RUNNING")'
```

### Reset a run

`POST /workflows/{workflowId}/reset` replays a run from an earlier point. The body names which point:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `resetType` | Required. `"first-workflow-task"` replays the run from the beginning with the input it started with. `"last-workflow-task"` resets to the most recent workflow task, which is how a run wedged on failing code is moved onto a fix. `"workflow-task-id"` targets one point from `reset-points`. |
| `eventId` | Required when `resetType` is `"workflow-task-id"`. The `eventId` of the chosen reset point. |
| `reason` | Optional. Recorded with the reset. |
| `reapply` | Optional. `{"type": …, "exclude": [...]}` decides which post-reset events are re-delivered to the new run. |

`reapply.type` is `"signal"` by default, which re-delivers signals, `"none"` re-delivers nothing, and `"all-eligible"` also re-delivers updates.

:::warning Resetting a durable agent
A durable agent's turns arrive as updates, not signals. Resetting an agent with the default `"signal"` therefore replays the agent without its conversation. Use `"all-eligible"` to keep the turns.

Each entry from `GET /workflows/{workflowId}/reset-points` carries an `eventId`, its `eventType`, a timestamp, the activity-tree `nodeIds` and `nodeNames` that the task scheduled, which all re-execute together, and `isFirstFailure`, which marks the point that re-runs the run's first failed step.

## Human tasks

| Method and path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /human-tasks` | List tasks. Filters: `status`, `parentWorkflowId`, `parentWorkflowType`, `taskName`, `userRole`, `taskQueue`, the four time bounds, and pagination with `limit` (default `20`) and `pageToken`. Visibility is filtered by the caller's roles. |
| `GET /human-tasks/pending-count` | Pending-task count for the caller's roles, for inbox badges. `taskQueue` narrows it, and `all=true` counts every pending task regardless of the caller. |
| `GET /human-tasks/{taskId}` | Task detail: title, description, payload, roles, and the decision form's JSON schema. |
| `POST /human-tasks/{taskId}/complete` | Complete with `{"result": {…}}` matching the task's decision type. |
| `POST /human-tasks/{taskId}/fail` | Fail the task with `{"reason": "..."}`, optionally with `details`. |
| `POST /human-tasks/{taskId}/reassign` | Change the audience. Any of `userRoles`, `users`, `excludedRoles`, `excludedUsers`. |
| `POST /human-tasks/{taskId}/deadline` | Set `{"timeoutMillis": …}`. Omit the field, or send null, to clear the deadline. |

Under scope enforcement, `all=true` on the pending count additionally requires either the human-task manage scope or the workflow manage scope, since a caller-independent total is a management view.

There is deliberately **no cancel endpoint for a human task**. A task becomes `CANCELED` only internally, when its parent workflow closes. To end one from outside, terminate the task workflow instead.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8234/workflow/human-tasks/$TASK_ID/complete" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-user-id: alice' -H 'x-user-roles: manager' \
  -d '{"result": {"action": "REQUEST_BILL", "comment": "Please attach the receipts"}}'
```

## Review activities

Approval gates, raised before a gated step runs, and failure reviews, raised after a step fails, share one surface.

| Method and path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /review-activities` | List reviews. Filters: `status`, `parentWorkflowId`, `taskName`, `taskQueue`, the four time bounds, and pagination. Same role-based visibility as human tasks. |
| `GET /review-activities/{taskId}` | Review detail: the activity, its proposed or failing input, the error for a failure review, and the input form's JSON schema. |
| `POST /review-activities/{taskId}/proceed` | Run, or rerun, with the original input. |
| `POST /review-activities/{taskId}/proceed-with-input` | Run, or rerun, with corrected input: `{"input": {…}}`. |
| `POST /review-activities/{taskId}/reject` | Skip the gated call, or surface the failure to the workflow. Optional body `{"feedback": "..."}`. |
| `POST /review-activities/{taskId}/reassign` | Change the audience, as for a human task. |
| `POST /review-activities/{taskId}/deadline` | Set or clear the deadline, as for a human task. |
| `POST /review-activities/bulk-retry` | Decide many failure reviews at once. See [Decide reviews in bulk](#decide-reviews-in-bulk). |

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8234/workflow/review-activities/$TASK_ID/proceed-with-input" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'x-user-id: alice' -H 'x-user-roles: manager' \
  -d '{"input": {"claimId": "EXP-1", "amount": 180.50, "currency": "EUR"}}'
```

### Decide reviews in bulk

`POST /review-activities/bulk-retry` retries or fails many failed-activity reviews in one call.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `action` | Required. `"retry"` or `"fail"`. |
| `taskIds` | An array of review activity IDs. Send this or `parentWorkflowId`, not both. |
| `parentWorkflowId` | Selects every pending failure review of one workflow. |
| `activityName` | Narrows a `parentWorkflowId` selection to one activity. |
| `feedback` | Accompanies `"fail"`. |

The call responds `200` with a per-task report whenever the batch was accepted, including when some tasks were skipped or failed. Only a malformed selection is a `400`.

A bulk decision cannot change the arguments an activity is retried with, because there is no field for replacement input. Correct an argument through `proceed-with-input` on the individual review.

## Response codes

Operations report why they failed in a protocol-independent way, and the HTTP adapter maps that reason to a status code:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `400 Bad Request` | The request was invalid, such as a malformed bulk selection. |
| `403 Forbidden` | The caller's roles or scopes do not permit the operation. |
| `404 Not Found` | No such workflow, task, or review. |
| `409 Conflict` | The target is not in a state that allows the operation. |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | The payload did not match what the workflow or task expects. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | The operation failed for any other reason. |
