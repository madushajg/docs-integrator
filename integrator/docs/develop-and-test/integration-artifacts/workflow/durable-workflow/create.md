# Create a Workflow

A **durable workflow** is an artifact in your integration, the same as a service or an automation. You create it once, give it the shape of the data it starts with, and then design its steps on a diagram.

## Launch the wizard

1. In the design view, click **+ Add Artifact**.
2. On the **Artifacts** page, under **Durable Workflow**, click **Durable Workflow**.

   <ThemedImage
       alt="The Artifacts page with the Durable Workflow card under the Durable Workflow section"
       sources={{
           light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/develop/create-workflow/add-artifact.png'),
           dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/develop/create-workflow/add-artifact.png'),
       }}
   />

   **Durable Agentic Workflow** beside it produces the same kind of artifact, but you describe the goal and let a model choose the steps instead of wiring them yourself. See [Create a Durable Agent](../durable-agentic-workflow/create-durable-agent.md).

3. Fill in the **Create New Durable Workflow** form:

   | Field | Required | Description |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Name** | Yes | The workflow's identifier. It is how the workflow is referenced when it is started, and the name it appears under in workflow management. |
   | **Workflow Input Data Type** | No | The type of the data the workflow starts with, usually a record. See [Types](../../supportive-artifacts/types.md). |

   :::tip Design it for the launcher
   Whatever you put in this type is what every caller has to supply, including the form the [Integration Control Plane](../../../../icp/manage-workflows/start-a-workflow.md) generates for starting a run by hand. Keep it to the data the process actually needs.

   <ThemedImage
       alt="The Create New Durable Workflow form with Name set to orderWorkflow and Workflow Input Data Type set to OrderInfo"
       sources={{
           light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/develop/create-workflow/create-workflow-form.png'),
           dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/develop/create-workflow/create-workflow-form.png'),
       }}
   />

4. Click **Create**.

The workflow opens on its own diagram with a single **Start** node and appears under **Workflows** in the sidebar.

For a worked example that fills this in end to end, see [Build an order processing workflow](../../../../get-started/quickstarts/build-order-processing.md).

## Design the steps

The workflow diagram is the same flow diagram used everywhere else in WSO2 Integrator, with a group of durable steps added to the node panel:

| Group | What it holds |
|---|---|
| **Workflow** > **Steps** | [Call Activity](activities.md), [Await Human Task](await-human-task.md), [Await Data Event](data-events.md), and [Sleep](durable-timers.md). |
| **Workflow** > **Workflow Functions** | Replay-safe helpers: current time, whether the run is replaying, and the run's own ID and type. |
| **Statement**, **Control**, **Error Handling** | The ordinary building blocks: variables, function calls, `if`, `while`, `foreach`, and error handling. |

## Next steps

- [Start a workflow](start.md) — launch a run from a service, an automation, or the console.
- [Activities](activities.md) — the recorded units of work a workflow calls.
- [Build an order processing workflow](../../../../get-started/quickstarts/build-order-processing.md) — the whole flow, step by step.
