# Workflow Permissions

The **Workflows** and **Human Tasks** views in the Integration Control Plane are gated by role-based access, so each person sees only the work that belongs to them. This page covers the permissions that open each view and the roles that carry them by default.

## The Workflow-Management permissions

Workflow management adds four permissions in the **Workflow-Management** domain. Assign them through roles and groups, the same way as every other ICP permission. See [Access control](../access-control.md) for the model.

| Permission                        | Allows                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `workflow_mgt:view_workflows`     | View workflow executions.                                                                         |
| `workflow_mgt:manage_workflows`   | Start, suspend, resume, cancel, and terminate workflow executions, and decide review activities.  |
| `workflow_mgt:view_human_tasks`   | View human tasks.                                                                                 |
| `workflow_mgt:manage_human_tasks` | Complete, fail, and cancel human tasks, and decide review activities.                             |

## Default role grants

| Role                              | Human tasks     | Workflow executions |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Super Admin, Admin, Project Admin | View and manage | View and manage     |
| Developer                         | View and manage | View only           |
| Viewer                            | View only       | No access           |

:::warning Project-scope access
The project-level **Workflows** page checks permissions granted at project level or above. A user whose workflow permissions were granted only on individual integrations does not pass that check and must use the integration-level page instead.

## How roles decide who sees a task

:::note Permissions open the view, roles fill it
Permissions decide who can open the workflow views. **Roles** decide which tasks and reviews appear inside them.

When you open a task list, ICP forwards your ICP role names to the runtime, and the runtime returns only the tasks whose eligible roles include one of them. Matching is an exact, case-sensitive comparison of role names, so a task declared for `manager` in the workflow code is visible only to users holding an ICP role named exactly `manager`.

```ballerina
RequestDecision request = check ctx->awaitHumanTask("checkExpenseRequest", "manager",
        payload = {"claimId": claim.claimId, "amount": claim.amount});
```

Create the ICP roles that are required to complete the human task (`manager`, `finance`, `support-lead`, and so on), grant them the workflow permissions above, and map them to the groups whose members should decide those tasks.

Super admins are also given a synthetic `admin` role when calls reach the runtime. That role matches only tasks and reviews that explicitly declare `admin`, so it is not a way to see everything.
