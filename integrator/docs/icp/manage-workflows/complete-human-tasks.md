# Complete Human Tasks

When a durable workflow reaches a point only a person can settle, it suspends and puts the work on the **Human Tasks** page of the Integration Control Plane. Nothing is held open while it waits, so the work can sit there for minutes or for months, and the workflow resumes the moment someone decides it.

Two kinds of work arrive on that page:

- A **task** asks a person for something the workflow cannot compute, such as validating an order or judging a claim. You complete a form, and the workflow resumes with what you submit. See [Await Human Task](../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/workflow/durable-workflow/await-human-task.md).
- A **review activity** is a decision attached to an activity rather than a freestanding question. It is raised in two cases:

  - **After an activity fails**, when its retry policy is **Human Review**, so a person decides whether to retry it. See [Human review failed activities](../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/workflow/durable-workflow/review-activity-and-error-handling.md#human-review--when-a-person-should-fix-it).
  - **Before an activity runs**, when a durable agent registered it with **Requires Approval**, so a person approves the call first. See [Durable agent activities](../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/workflow/durable-agentic-workflow/create-durable-agent.md#activities).

:::info Prerequisites

- For tasks: `workflow_mgt:view_human_tasks` or `workflow_mgt:manage_human_tasks` permission to see them, and `workflow_mgt:manage_human_tasks` to act on them
- For review activities: any Workflow-Management permission to see them, and `workflow_mgt:manage_human_tasks` or `workflow_mgt:manage_workflows` to decide them ([Workflow permissions](workflow-permissions.md))

## Reviewers need their roles

A task or review activity is addressed to the roles the workflow declares, and **Human Tasks** shows a user only the tasks applicable to them. Create each role the workflow names, such as a `Finance` role on an approval gate, and attach it to the group that holds those users, or the task reaches nobody. See [Access control](../access-control.md).

Permissions and roles do different jobs. A permission decides whether you may open the page and act at all, and the role name decides which items you see. Holding the permission without a matching role shows you nothing to decide, which is why a task can be listed as **Read-only**.

## Find your tasks

In the integration view, open **Human Tasks** in the sidebar and pick an environment. The page holds one queue of the work waiting on a person: human tasks and the review activities raised by gated or failed activities. Only the items applicable to you are listed.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The Human Tasks page listing three pending items for one integration: a review failure, a human task, and an approval gate review"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/human-tasks-page.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/human-tasks-page.png'),
    }}
/>

### Filter the queue

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Search by workflow ID** | Narrows the list to the items belonging to one workflow instance. |
| **Type** | **All**, **Tasks**, or **Reviews**. Shown only when you can see both kinds. |
| **Status** | **Pending** when the page opens. Also **All**, **Completed**, **Failed**, **Canceled**, and **Terminated**. |
| **Workflow Name** | Narrows to one workflow definition. |
| Time range | Narrows to the items started in a period. **Any time** when the page opens. |
| **Integration** | Narrows to one integration. Shown at project level when more than one integration is in scope. |
| **Clear** | Appears as soon as a filter differs from its default, and resets them all. |
| **Select reviews…** | Starts a selection of pending reviews to retry or fail together. It is disabled when the list holds none, because human tasks are completed one at a time through their own form. |

:::tip Keeping the list current
Beside the filters, the refresh icon fetches immediately, and the **auto-refresh** toggle next to the **Updated** time keeps the view checking for fresher data every 30 seconds. Turn it off and the view updates only when you refresh it.

### Read the list

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task** | The item's title, with an icon for its kind. A review activity also carries a badge reading **Approval gate**, **Review failure**, or **Review**. A **Read-only** badge means you can see the item but hold no matching role to complete it. |
| **Workflow Name** | The workflow definition the parent instance runs. |
| **Integration** | The integration whose runtime owns the item, resolved from its task queue. Shown at project level when more than one integration is in scope. |
| **Task ID** | The item's own identifier, which the management API and audit records use to name it. |
| **Workflow ID** | The parent workflow instance waiting on this item. |
| **Status** | Pending, Completed, Failed, Canceled, or Terminated. |
| **Started** | When the item was created. |

Click a row to open it. A human task opens the form described in [Complete a human task](#complete-a-human-task); a review activity opens the decision panel described in [Decide a review activity](#decide-a-review-activity). The footer counts the items loaded so far and offers to load more when the queue runs past one page.

### Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Pending** | Waiting for someone to decide it. |
| **Completed** | Someone decided it and the workflow resumed. A rejected review also completes; its failure is what travels to the workflow. |
| **Failed** | A human task that was failed through **Mark as Failed**, or that reached its deadline before anyone acted. |
| **Canceled** | Retired without a decision, for example because the run it belonged to closed. |
| **Terminated** | Ended without a decision when the underlying task or its run was terminated. |

Only a pending item can be decided. A completed, failed, canceled, or terminated item still opens, but it opens read-only, with its decision and result recorded instead of the action cards.

## Complete a human task

Open a human task from the queue. The panel gathers what you need in order to answer it.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The detail panel of the Validate Order human task, showing its task fields including Eligible Roles and Administrators, its read-only input, the Complete Task and Mark as Failed actions, and the Administer card"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/human-task-detail.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/human-task-detail.png'),
    }}
/>

| Card | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The context the workflow supplied. Shown only when the task carries one. |
| **Task** | **Task Name**, the **Workflow Name** and **Parent Workflow** it belongs to, when it was **Created**, the **Eligible Roles** that may complete it, and the **Administrators** who may reassign it or change its deadline. Each row of roles is shown as one chip per role. |
| **Task Input** | The payload the workflow sent with the task, read-only, one row per value. Use the braces icon to read it as JSON, or the copy icon to copy it. |
| **Actions** | **Complete Task** and **Mark as Failed**. Shown while the task is pending, to users holding `workflow_mgt:manage_human_tasks`. |
| **Administer** | **Reassign** and **Change Deadline**. Shown while the task is pending, to users holding one of its administrator roles. See [Administer a task](#administer-a-task). |

### Submit a result

**Complete Task** opens the form the workflow expects, under the line *The result the workflow resumes with*.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The Validate Order task with Complete Task selected, opening the result form with a Valid Yes/No toggle, a Reason box, the Edit as JSON link, and the Review before completion button"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/human-task-complete-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/human-task-complete-form.png'),
    }}
/>

The fields come from the result type the workflow declared for the task. See [Await Human Task](../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/workflow/durable-workflow/await-human-task.md).

```ballerina
public type OrderValidation record {|
    boolean valid;
    string reason = "";
|};

OrderValidation decision = check ctx->awaitHumanTask("Validate Order", "Admin",
        payload = order);
```

That record renders as a **Valid** Yes/No toggle and a **Reason** text box. Each declared type maps to a control:

| Type in the workflow | Control in the console |
| --- | --- |
| `string` | Text box |
| Enum or union of string constants | Dropdown of the allowed values |
| `int`, `decimal`, `float` | Text box validated as a number |
| `boolean` | Yes/No toggle |
| Nested record | An indented group of that record's own fields |
| Open record, `map`, or array | Multi-line box where you enter JSON |

Required fields carry a red asterisk. **Edit as JSON** swaps the form for a raw editor carrying the values you have entered so far, which is useful when a value does not fit the generated controls; the raw text is then submitted exactly as typed, and **Back to form** returns to the fields. A task that declares no result schema opens in that raw editor from the start.

**Review before completion** shows the exact result to be submitted and asks you to confirm it. **Complete Task** on that dialog sends it, and the waiting workflow resumes with it. The completion cannot be undone.

Keep result records small. Whatever the record declares is exactly what the person on the other end has to fill in, so a decision flag plus a short reason usually reads better than a long form.

### Mark a task as failed

**Mark as Failed** ends the task without a result. A **Reason** is required and is relayed to the workflow as the failure reason. The task is recorded as **Failed**, the failure is propagated to the workflow, and the workflow decides what happens next, for example by escalating to another role or by ending the process.

Use it when the task cannot be answered at all. To answer with a rejection the workflow already expects, complete the task with the rejecting value instead, so the run follows its normal rejection path.

## Decide a review activity

A review activity names the activity it guards, and its **Trigger** says why it was raised:

| Trigger | Raised | What you are deciding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Approval gate — review before the activity runs** | Before a gated activity runs, including every activity a durable agent registered with **Requires Approval** | Whether the call should be made at all, and with which arguments |
| **Review failure — decide the failed activity's retry** | After an activity failed | Whether to run it again, with the original or corrected arguments, or to let the failure reach the workflow |

<ThemedImage
    alt="The detail panel of an approval gate on the payClaim activity, with its activity fields, its read-only arguments, and the Proceed, Proceed with Changes, and Reject decisions"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/approval-gate-review.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/approval-gate-review.png'),
    }}
/>

| Card | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | What the review is for, naming the activity and, for a failure, the error it raised. |
| **Activity** | **Activity Name**, **Workflow Name**, **Parent Workflow**, **Trigger**, **Created**, and **Administrators**, plus the **Error** on a failure review. **Administrators** reads **Not provided** when the review names none. |
| **Activity Arguments** | The arguments the activity would run with, read-only. |
| **Decisions** | **Proceed**, **Proceed with Changes**, and **Reject**. Shown while the review is pending, to users holding `workflow_mgt:manage_human_tasks` or `workflow_mgt:manage_workflows`. |

### Proceed

**Proceed** runs the activity with the arguments exactly as recorded. On a failure review it retries them instead. **Confirm Proceed** repeats the arguments and warns that the decision cannot be undone, before anything runs.

### Proceed with changes

**Proceed with Changes** opens the arguments for editing, in a form generated from the activity's parameters and pre-filled with the proposed values. It is how you correct a bad argument before the step runs, or fix the input that made it fail.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The payClaim approval gate with Proceed with Changes selected, opening the Claim Id and Amount arguments for editing above the Review Changes button"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/approval-gate-edit-arguments.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/approval-gate-edit-arguments.png'),
    }}
/>

### Reject

**Reject** fails the activity instead of running it. **Feedback** is optional and is relayed to the workflow as the rejection reason.

Rejecting completes the review as a failure and propagates that failure to the workflow, which decides what happens next. An approval gate you reject never makes the call; a failure review you reject surfaces the original failure. Either way the review itself completes, so a rejected review is listed under **Completed** with its decision recorded, rather than under **Failed**.

### Review a failed activity

A failure review reads the same way as an approval gate, with one addition: the **Error** row and the description carry the message the attempt failed with, so you can tell whether a retry is worth it.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The detail panel of a failure review on the processBatch activity, showing the Error row reading Incorrect offset and the Proceed, Proceed with Changes, and Reject retry decisions"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/failed-activity-review.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/failed-activity-review.png'),
    }}
/>

Because the activity has already run, the decisions read as a retry: **Proceed** retries with the original arguments, **Proceed with Changes** retries with corrected ones, and **Reject** lets the failure reach the workflow.

### Decide several reviews at once

**Select reviews…** above the list turns on checkboxes for the pending reviews, and the banner reports how many can be selected. **Retry Selected** reruns each selected activity with its original arguments, and **Fail Selected** rejects them all with one optional feedback note. Each dialog confirms the count before anything is sent, and the result reports how many were applied, skipped, and errored.

A bulk decision cannot edit arguments, so correct an input through **Proceed with Changes** on the review itself. Human tasks are never selectable here, because each one is completed through its own form.

## Administer a task

Completing a task and administering it are separate jobs. The **Eligible Roles** decide the task; the **Administrators** decide who gets to decide it, and how long they have. Both are named when the work is created, and both are shown on the item: the **Task** card carries an **Administrators** row on a human task, and the **Activity** card carries one on a review activity, reading **Not provided** when the work names no administrator.

When you hold one of those administrator roles, a pending item carries an **Administer** card below **Actions**, reading *You administer this task. Each action below is recorded in its history under your name.* It offers **Reassign** and **Change Deadline**.

Neither action decides the item. The task stays **Pending**, and the workflow stays suspended, until someone from the audience completes it or fails it.

:::tip Administering is governed by role name
The **Administer** card reaches you only when you hold an ICP role whose name matches one of the item's **Administrators**. The same exact, case-sensitive match applies to the roles you type into **Reassign**, so a role named there reaches nobody until an ICP role of that exact name exists and is mapped to a group. See [Reviewers need their roles](#reviewers-need-their-roles).

### Reassign

**Reassign** hands the task to a new audience. The form opens pre-filled with the audience the task currently carries, so an unedited field keeps what it had.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The Administer card on the Validate Order task with Reassign selected, showing the Roles, Users, Excluded roles, and Excluded users boxes above the Reassign button"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/administer-reassign.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/administer-reassign.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | What it takes |
| --- | --- |
| **Roles** | One role name per line. Anyone holding one of these may complete the task. |
| **Users** | One user ID per line, for handing the task to named people rather than to a role. |
| **Excluded roles** | One role name per line, kept out of the audience. |
| **Excluded users** | One user ID per line, kept out of the audience. |

The task needs at least one role or user, so you cannot reassign it to nobody. **Reassign** applies the new audience and **Cancel** closes the form without changing it.

### Change deadline

**Change Deadline** replaces the deadline the task is carrying, under the line *The new deadline, counted from now*.

<ThemedImage
    alt="The Administer card on the Validate Order task with Change Deadline selected, showing the Days, Hours, and Minutes steppers above the Clear deadline and Extend buttons"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/administer-change-deadline.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/human-tasks/administer-change-deadline.png'),
    }}
/>

Set **Days**, **Hours**, and **Minutes**, and **Extend** applies that span measured from now, not from when the task was created or from its existing deadline. **Clear deadline** removes the deadline instead, which leaves the task open until someone decides it. **Cancel** closes the form without changing anything.

The deadline is the **Timeout** the workflow declared for the task. See [Bound the wait](../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/workflow/durable-workflow/await-human-task.md#bound-the-wait). A task that reaches it with nobody acting is recorded as **Failed**, and the waiting workflow is resumed with that error to handle. Extending the deadline is therefore how you keep a run alive when the person who has to answer cannot answer yet, and clearing it is how you take the time limit off a task altogether.
