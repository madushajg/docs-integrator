# Workflow Executions

The **Workflow Executions** page lists the runs created by workflows in the selected integration and environment. Select a run to view its status, input, and execution flow, and to reset, suspend, resume, cancel, or terminate it.

:::info Prerequisites

- The `workflow_mgt:view_workflows` permission to browse and view executions.
- The `workflow_mgt:manage_workflows` permission to reset, suspend, resume, cancel, or terminate an execution.

## Open the workflow executions page

Select **Workflows** in the console navigation. The console opens the **Workflow Executions** page for the current integration.

The page header shows the integration name and an environment selector. Use the selector to switch between environments such as `dev` and `prod`.

## Browse executions

### Filter executions

Use the following filters to find an execution:

| Filter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Search by workflow ID** | Finds an execution by its workflow ID. |
| **Status** | Filters executions by status: **All**, **Running**, **Completed**, **Failed**, **Terminated**, **Canceled**, or **Timed out**. |
| **Workflow Name** | Filters the list by workflow definition, such as `orderWorkflow` or `paymentWorkflow`. |
| **Any time** | Filters the list by time range: **Past 10 minutes**, **Past 30 minutes**, **Past 1 hour**, **Past 24 hours**, or **Custom**. |

### Page actions

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Refresh** | Reloads the execution list. |
| **Start New Workflow** | Opens the form for starting a new workflow execution. |

When auto-refresh is enabled, the console periodically retrieves the latest execution data without requiring a manual refresh.

### Execution list columns

Each row in the list is one workflow execution, listed newest first. The columns show:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Workflow ID** | The identifier of the workflow execution. A copy icon next to the value copies the ID. |
| **Run ID** | The identifier assigned to the individual workflow run. A copy icon next to the value copies the ID. |
| **Workflow Name** | The workflow definition used to create the execution. |
| **Status** | The current state of the execution, such as **Running**, **Completed**, **Suspended**, **Terminated**, or **Canceled**. |
| **Started** | The date and time when the execution started. |

## View an execution

Select an execution in the list to open the **Execution Details** panel.

<ThemedImage

        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/execution-details.gif'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/execution-details.gif'),
    }}
/>

The panel header holds the action buttons, which are covered in [Manage an execution](#manage-an-execution). Below the header, the panel shows the execution's status and details, its input, and its flow.

### Execution status and details

The **Execution** card shows the current status of the run and the details that identify it.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Status** | The current state of the execution, shown as a badge next to the **Execution** title. For example, **Running**, **Suspended**, or **Completed**. |
| **Instance ID** | A unique identifier for this execution. A copy icon next to the value copies the ID. |
| **Workflow Name** | The workflow definition this execution is an instance of, such as `orderWorkflow`. |
| **Started** | The date and time the execution began. |
| **Closed** | The date and time the execution finished. This field appears only after the execution is no longer running. |

        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/execution_details.png'),
    }}
/>

### Workflow input

The **Workflow Input** card shows the data that was provided when the execution started. For example, if you started a workflow with a customer's order details, those details appear here.

Use the **`{}`** icon to switch between the structured view and the raw JSON view. Select the **copy** icon to copy the workflow input.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/workflowInput.png'),
    }}
/>

### Execution flow

The **Execution Flow** section shows the steps in a workflow execution and how they are connected. For example, it can show:

- `reserveInventory` — an activity that completed successfully.
- `payment` — a data event that is waiting for data.
- `if payment` — a conditional step that determines which branch to execute.
- `sendEmail` — the branch that was executed.
- `cancelOrder` — the other branch, which was not executed.

The timeline next to the flow shows when each step ran, how long it took, and the total execution time.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Execution flow diagram and timeline showing each step's status, duration, and the total running time"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/execution-flow-timeline.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/execution-flow-timeline.png'),
    }}
/>

Select a step to view its details, including the input and execution status.

<ThemedImage

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/step-details.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/step-details.png'),
    }}
/>

The execution flow is generated from workflow checkpoints and is an approximation of the execution. It may not show every action performed during the workflow run.

## Manage an execution

Use the action buttons in the panel header to change what happens to an execution:

- **Reset** replays the workflow from an earlier point in its history.
- **Suspend** pauses a running execution at its current position, and **Resume** continues it from where it paused.
- **Cancel** stops the execution gracefully, so the workflow can run its own cleanup logic.
- **Terminate** stops the execution immediately, without running any cleanup logic.

The panel shows only the buttons that apply to the execution's current status and your permissions. For example, a completed execution has no **Suspend** button, and **Resume** appears only while the execution is suspended.

### Reset a workflow

Select **Reset** to open the **Reset Workflow** dialog, and then choose where to replay from:

- **Before the last step** redoes only the most recent workflow task.
- **From the beginning** reruns the whole workflow with its original input.
- **A specific point in this run's history** starts the replay from a history point you select.

<ThemedImage

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/reset-workflow-history.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/reset-workflow-history.png'),
    }}
/>

Optionally, enter a **Reason**. Then select **Reset Workflow** to confirm, or **Back** to cancel.

### Suspend and resume an execution

The status doesn't change the moment you select **Suspend**. It can still read **Running** for a short time, because the console sends the suspension to the workflow as a signal instead of applying it immediately. Once the workflow engine confirms that the run has paused, the status changes to **Suspended** and **Resume** replaces **Suspend**.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Execution details of a suspended execution with the Suspended status and the Resume button highlighted"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/suspended-execution.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/workflows/icp/suspended-execution.png'),
    }}
/>

### Cancel or terminate an execution

**Terminate** asks you to confirm and enter a reason, and you can't undo it. Prefer **Cancel** when the workflow has cleanup logic that needs to run.
